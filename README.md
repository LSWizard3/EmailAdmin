# Administrator EmailApplication

I created this application after working at my first ever retail job, where I receieved
a customized email address and a random password my first day of work. This immediately
sparked my curiousity so I hopped onto my Java IDE the next day and starting working on 
a project that would be able to emulate this same system. In my application the program 
will take in the user's information and department, and then create a customized email 
address, along with an alternate email, and randomly generated password.
